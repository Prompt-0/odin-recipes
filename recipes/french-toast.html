    <p> This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. 
        I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make! </p>

    <p> This fluffy French toast recipe is crisp on the outside, but perfectly soft and tender on the inside. </p>

    <h3> What Makes French Toast Fluffy? </h3>

        Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results. 
        This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside.  </p>
